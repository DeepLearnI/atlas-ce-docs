<h1>Installation Guide</h1>

*Foundations* only support Python 3 and above versions. 

First, lets install the Foundations library and then follow a [step-by-step](../step_by_step
_guide/) guide to see how it can be used.

#Installing Foundations Environment

##OSX/Linux

It's recommended that you use either [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) to setup your Foundations environment.

Note: if using `virtualenv` make sure to create the environment outside the project directory as the directory will be compressed, and any extra dependencies will add to size and time for job running.

There are a few ways to install Foundations library, either by `Pip`, Wheel installation or from the source directly.

<h3>Using Pip</h3>
For Pip access, you will need a pip.conf or pip.ini with credentials to Dessa's private pip repository. This file should be placed in the `~/.config/pip` directory.

Once setup, Foundations can be installed with:

```bash
pip install dessa-foundations
```

<h3>Wheel Installation</h3>
The `.whl` files for Python 3.X are available and can be provided by the Dessa team.
There are different assets based on different job deployment strategies.

You only need `foundations-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` file for initial Foundations deployment.

Run the following command to install Foundations:
```
python -m pip install -U <path-to-downloaded-whl-file>
```

<h3>Install from source</h3>

Download Foundations' source code from Github via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepLearnI/foundations
```
In the root of the repo specify Python version and run:
```bash 
./build_dist.sh
```
This will build a new `.whl` file of Foundations and install it within your `conda` or `virtualenv` environment.

##Windows

You will need to install [git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [anaconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). To run Foundations correctly, you will need to run all comands from an Anaconda prompt.

<h3>1. Setup Virtual Environment</h3>

- Open an Anaconda prompt
- Create a new conda environment by running
```bash
conda create --name found-env python=3.6
```
- Activate the environment by running
```bash
conda activate found-env
```

<h3>2a. Install Foundations via Pip </h3>

For Pip access, you will need a pip.conf or pip.ini with credentials to Dessa's private pip repository. This file should be placed in the `~/AppData/Roaming/pip/pip.conf` directory.

Once setup, Foundations can be installed with:

```bash
pip install dessa-foundations
```

<h3>2b. Install Foundations WHL </h3>

The `.whl` files for Python 3.X are available and will be provided by the Dessa team. There are different assets based on different job deployment strategies.

You only need `foundations-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` file for initial Foundations deployment.

Run the following command to install Foundations:
```
python -m pip install -U <path-to-downloaded-whl-file>
```

## Environment and Dependencies

When installing from the source code, Foundations comes with a few dependencies that you'll see in `requirements.txt`. These are used to specify which packages are required for Foundations to run correctly. 

In addition, users can also specify specifc `requirements.txt` at the job level. By creating a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory as your driver code, the dependencies defined in the file will be  used when you run a job depending on your setup and deployment type. To get to know the different deployment types better see our docs on [configurations](../configs/).

If working with a remote deployment like GCP you'll need to know if the environment has the ability to download packages from the Internet. If yes, then specifying new dependencies in the job-level `requirements.txt` will allow the execution environment to download the necessary packages.

If the environment doesn't have access to the Internet, expect that it will only use packages already installed by the system integrator. If additional packages need to be installed the job will not run. In the `stderr`, there will be a message notifying the user that the package could not be downloaded.

*If you run multiple jobs with different requirements, which one is used?*
If you have a `requirements.txt` in the same directory (root) as your job deployment code, that requirements file will be packaged and sent along with the job to tell the execution environment what dependencies are needed. If using the [Foundations CLI](../foundations_cli/) `init` command to setup a project directory, this would be the project_code directory. Any additional changes to `requirements.txt` will only effect future jobs.

**Takeaway: if you expect a job to run with an external python package, you'll need to add it to your `requirements.txt` and the execution environment will need access to Internet to download.**

It's important to note: if you're looking to use a different version of a package than is installed by default on the execution environment (maybe XGBoost is installed on your GCP environment already), specifying a different version in your `requirements.txt` will **NOT** override the execution version. You'll need update the execution environment's version to do so.

Keep in mind that every time a job is run, a fresh python environment is created in the execution environment and all dependencies associated with the `requirements.txt` are installed. This freshly created python environment also inherits any packages installed globally on the execution environment.

## Redis Setup
<h3> Foundations CLI </h3>

To download and setup Redis, users can use the Foundations CLI command:

```shellscript
$ foundations setup
```

This will automatically pull and run the Redis via Docker as well as the Foundations GUI. Once completed, the GUI can be accessed at `https://localhost:6443`

**Note:** This method will require users to have access to the private Dessa docker repository. This can be accessed with `docker login <Dessa Repo URL>`. For more information on getting access, please reach out to the Dessa integrations team. 

<h3> Manual Setup </h3>

The Foundations uses Redis as a quick and efficient way to store data for experiments. In order to run Foundations with local deployment, you'll first need to install Redis. Note: The following steps will apply for local job deployments only, the Dessa team will setup the Redis for any remote deployments (GCP, AWS, etc.)

Steps to running Redis:

- download and [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if not already installed
- download redis with `docker pull redis`
- start redis with `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis`

The `-d` option will allows us to run in detached mode, so you don't have to keep your shell open.

The `-p` option allows us to publish a container's port to the host. In this case this means we've told docker that port 6379 inside the container should map to port 6379 of our machine.

Now that redis is running, when you run a job locally it'll get picked and and handled by Redis. Additionally anytime you read results, Foundations will access the Redis store.

If you want to stop the Redis container, run `docker ps`, get the container's ID, and then run `docker stop <container_id>`.

**Note: Other instances of Redis (such as via Homebrew) running on the same machine may interfere with this setup.** We recommend stopping or disabling other instances and running Redis through Docker.  
  
To stop Homebrew Redis instances:   
  
<span>1. </span>In bash or terminal, check the process status:
```bash
ps aux | grep redis
```

Then kill the process with:  
```bash
kill <process id>
```  
  
<span>2. </span>Uninstall Redis with:  
```bash
brew uninstall redis
```

## Installing and Running the GUI

<h2>About the GUI</h2>
Foundations provides a user interface with which one can view all information about jobs, including status (e.g. queued, running, completed) as well as logged metrics and start time.  

<h2>Foundations CLI</h2>

To setup the GUI, users can use the Foundations CLI command:

```shellscript
$ foundations setup
```

This will automatically pull and run the Redis via Docker as well as the Foundations GUI. Once completed, the GUI can be accessed at `https://localhost:6443`

**Note:** This method will require users to have access to the private Dessa docker repository. This can be accessed with `docker login <Dessa Repo URL>`. For more information on getting access, please reach out to the Dessa integrations team. 

<h3> HTTPS on the GUI </h3>

The GUI by default is built with a provided self signed SSL certificate that works on localhost only. This means that you will only be able to access the GUI from localhost, and after accepting that your connection may not be secure through the browser (this is a standard self signed certificate situation).

To get around this, you will need to supply a `key` file and `crt` file generated by a certificate authority. This can usually be done by contacting your host provider.

<h2> Known Issues Running On OSX </h2>
There are some known issues related to networking with Docker on OSX, which could appear as we use Docker as the backend to run the GUI. Please see [the networking features documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/) for details and limitations.

## Deploying Jobs

For full documentation on how to deploy jobs, please refer to the documentation[here](../configs/#how-to-deploy).

<h2>Windows</h2>

To deploy jobs on Windows, users can use different configuration files to specify where the job should be run. 

<h3>Setting up local configuration</h3>

In order to get Foundations working correctly on Windows, you'll have to ensure that you environment is set up correctly. When installing software dependencies (such as Anaconda or Git), the default installation settings should be sufficient to get things working.

<h3> Deploying jobs</h3>
As per the [project creation](../foundations_cli/#project-creation) command, new projects will automatically have a local configuration to start deploying jobs using Foundations.

<h3> Local deployment</h3>
```yml
job_deployment_env: local
results_config:
    archive_end_point: C:\\foundations\\foundations-archive
    redis_end_point: redis://localhost:6379
cache_config:
    end_point: C:\\foundations\\foundations-cache
log_level: INFO
```
 Please take note that when specifying different paths for the configuration options on Windows, all paths must be prefixed by the Windows partition (ie `C:\\`) that they are located on.

<h3> Deploying remote jobs from Windows</h3>
It is also important to understand that if you are deploying from Windows to the Foundations scheduler that the paths defined in you configuration must retain their Linux form. For example, we would use `/path/to/remote/jobs` instead of `C:\path\to\remote\jobs`
