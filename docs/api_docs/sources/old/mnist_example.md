<h1>Training a Neural Network on the MNIST Dataset</h1>

In this example, we will use Foundations and Keras to train a simple Neural Net on the famous MNIST dataset. We will be leveraging the dataset directly from keras, so no download of data is required. It is highly recommended to first create a new project using the Foundations CLI [command](../foundations_cli/#project-creation). The following example code will then go directly into the driver.py and model.py files respectively.

The workflow of the example will be as follows:  
<span>1. </span> Load the data  
<span>2. </span> Prepare the data  
<span>3. </span> Build the neural net  
<span>4. </span> Model training and validation

For best practices, rather than run the whole model in one call, we will divide each step in the model into independent functions, making model development more modular and easier to debug. Foundations will then be used to wrap these functions to perform provenance tracking, caching, prepping your job for deployment, etc.

Some additional python dependencies you will need include: `keras` `tensorflow`.  

These can be installed locally with `pip` or other package managers. For remote deployments, these additional libraries will need to be included in a `requirements.txt` file and placed in the project root directory. For more information on remote deployments, check out the example [here](../remote_deployment_example/). 

The directory structure should look like this to run the model correctly:
```
mnist_example
├── config
│   └── local.config.yaml
├── data
├── post_processing
│   └── results.py
├── project_code
│   ├── driver.py
│   └── model.py
└── README.txt
```
For additonal information on how to deploy the model, check out our documentation [here](../configs/#how-to-deploy). 

Note: This is **not** a complete course on deep learning. Instead, this tutorial is meant to get you from zero to your first 
model trained with Foundations with as little headache as possible!
---
##1. Load the dataset
First, lets load the dataset we'll be using for this example in the model.py file. Since we'll be using Keras, we'll need to import the dataset as well as a few other dependencies. 

```python
"""
model.py
"""
import numpy as np
import foundations

from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten
from keras.utils import np_utils

def load_data():
    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
```

In the driver.py file, we can now create our first stage (or step in the pipeline) for Foundations to manage.

```python
"""
driver.py
"""
import foundations

from model import load_data

# Set a project a name so that Foundations knows how to track the model when it is deployed
foundations.set_project_name("MNIST Example")

load_data = foundations.create_stage(load_data)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data().split(4)
```
Here, we've turned the `load_data` function into a Foundations stage which returns a callable with the exact same signature as the input `load_data` function. When Foundations runs the pipeline, it will be called in the same way as the input function, but will return a stage object instead which Foundations uses to track inputs and outputs.

Also, notice how we split the dataset above into training and test data. Because of this, when we turn `load_data` into a stage for Foundations to manage, we'll need to use the `.split()` [function](../running_stages/#split) in the driver file so that we correctly capture the number of returned values.  

##2. Prepare the data
Now that we have the data available, we need preprocess the data to ensure that our model can properly handle it. For example,  we will need to reduce the images down into a vector of pixels so that our MLP model can properly understand the inputs. We also want to normalize the pixel values from grey-scale to values between 0 and 1, as well as encode the outputs to values between 0-9 so we can classify the values in the images. In the model.py lets add a new function:

```python
"""
model.py
"""
def preprocess_data(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, num_classes):
    X_train = X_train.reshape(60000, 784)
    X_test = X_test.reshape(10000, 784)
    X_train = X_train.astype('float32')
    X_test = X_test.astype('float32')
    X_train /= 255
    X_test /= 255
    Y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
    Y_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)
    return X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test
```
In the driver.py, we can create a stage out of the preprocess_data function:  

```python
"""
driver.py
"""
import foundations

from model import load_data, preprocess_data

foundations.set_project_name("MNIST Example")

load_data = foundations.create_stage(load_data)
preprocess_data = foundations.create_stage(preprocess_data)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data().split(4)

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = preprocess_data(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, 10).split(4)
```
Here we pipe the outputs of the `load_data()` stage into the `preprocess_data()` stage. Outputs of one stage can be treated as standard variables, and can be used in future stages. Because the `preprocess_data` input function returns 4 values, we need to use `.split()` again to indicate to Foundations how many values are generated from the input function.

##3. Build the model
Now that we have loaded and processed the data, the next step is to build out our neural net using keras. Let's add a `build_model` function in the model.py file:  
```python
"""
model.py
"""
def build_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(512, input_shape=(784,)))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(512))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(10))
    model.add(Activation('softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    return model
```
In the driver.py file we create a `build_model` stage as the next step in our pipeline after loading and processing the data:
```python
"""
driver.py
"""
import foundations

from model import load_data, preprocess_data, build_model

foundations.set_project_name("MNIST Example")

load_data = foundations.create_stage(load_data)
preprocess_data = foundations.create_stage(preprocess_data)
build_model = foundations.create_stage(build_model)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data().split(4)

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = preprocess_data(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, 10).split(4)

model = build_model()
```
Although the stage we've created doesn't take in any inputs relative to previous stages in the pipeline, Foundations will still return a stage object which can be used in other future stages.

##4. Model Training and Validation
Finally, lets train our model! In the model.py file, lets add two functions: one for fitting the model itself, and one for evaluating the output results. Both functions require a keras model object as an input, which we will pass in through the driver.py file when we add these steps to the Foundations pipeline. We also want to track the final score and accuracy of the model, which we will use `foundations.log_metric` to track. As more experiements are run, Foundations will record the different values of the accuracy, allowing you to compare models and identify what inputs were used to get the best result:

```python
"""
model.py
"""
def train_model(batch_size, epoch, model, X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test):
    result = model.fit(X_train, Y_train,
              batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=epoch, verbose=1,
              validation_data=(X_test, Y_test))
    return model

def eval_model(model, X_test, Y_test):
    score = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test, verbose=1)
    foundations.log_metric('Test score:', score[0])
    foundations.log_metric('Test accuracy:', score[1])
```
In the driver.py file, we will use the previously created stage objects as inputs to the `train_model()` and `eval_model()` stages. After creating a stage, the useage is very similar to how normal functions are executed, making Foundations unintrusive to development practices.  

```python
"""
driver.py
"""
import foundations

from model import load_data, preprocess_data, build_model, train_model, eval_model

foundations.set_project_name("MNIST Example")

# Create stages based off pipeline functions for Foundations to run
load_data = foundations.create_stage(load_data)
preprocess_data = foundations.create_stage(preprocess_data)
build_model = foundations.create_stage(build_model)
train_model = foundations.create_stage(train_model)
eval_model = foundations.create_stage(eval_model)

# 1. Load data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data().split(4)

# 2. Process data
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = preprocess_data(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, 10).split(4)

# 3. Build the neural net 
model = build_model()

# 4.a Train the model
trained_model = train_model(128, 5, model, X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test)

# 4.b Validate the model
validation = eval_model(trained_model, X_test, Y_test)
```
Now that we've created five stages, the last thing is to let Foundations know which one to execute. When stages are created, Foundations tracks them with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the different defined stages. This allows stages to be run independently of each other for debugging or testing. In addition, all input and output stages prior to the executed stage in the DAG are automatically run as well so that the expected result can be properly captured.

Since we want to run the whole workflow, we call `.run()` on the **last** stage in this model (which is validation). This signals to Foundations that essentially we want to run the final stage, as well as every previous stage which has inputs to the final one.

```python
validation.run()
```
When we call `.run()` on the final stage, Foundations will execute all stages and properly pass in the returned values into the proper coressponding stages. Essentially, a graph of defined stages is created and will run all stages that lead to the final stage. This creates a workflow where each stage can have its own logging and tracking:
```
Foundations ─── load_data ──── preprocess_data ──── train_model ──── validation.run()
             │                                   │
             └─────────── build_model ───────────┘
```
##5. Deploying the Model and Reading Results
Now we're ready to deploy the model! To run the model locally, we will use the Foundations CLI command `deploy`. In the project root directory run:
```bash
$ foundations deploy project_code/driver.py --env=local
```
If sucessfully deployed, Foundations will run the job on your local machine. You can see from the output that the model ran 5 iterations with a batch size of 1028 samples, giving us a final accuracy of 97.88%!
```

To further improve the model, you can experiment with different models, transformations, and hyperparameters which can all be tracked with Foundations.
