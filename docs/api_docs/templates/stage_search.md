<h1>Hyperparameter Searching</h1>
The following methods are used to perform Hyperparameter tuning/search without having to write additional loops or code to iterate over a distribution. There are currently two available search types:

**Grid Search**: A technique typically used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a particular model. In Foundations, grid searching is automatically handled by deploying individal jobs for each *exact combination* of input Hyperparameter values. For example, if there are 2 Hyperparameters with 3 values each, Foundations will deploy 9 jobs and evaluate the model for each of the given Hyperparameter values. 

**Random Search**: A technique used where random combinations of the hyperparameters are assessed to find the best solution for the built model. With Foundations, random searching is automatically done by deploying indvidual jobs for random combinations of input Hyperparameter values. For example, if there are 2 Hyperparameters with 3 values each, Foundations will *randomly* pick combinations for each Hyperparameter of those values up to a specificed maximum number of iterations. 

**NOTE:** These features are **EXPERIMENTAL** and may be subject to change in future releases.
