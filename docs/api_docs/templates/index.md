Welcome to the Foundations Trial User Documentation! In the following sections, you will get a more in-depth understanding of Foundations' capabilities and how to use them. You can also check out the resources section for answers to [frequently asked questions](../faqs/) and the SDK reference documentation to find further information.

**Disclaimer:** Due to this being a trial, we’ve limited some of Foundations’ functionality. Additional features that Foundations supports but are not documented include: 

* Local machine setup and job deployments
* Automatic project creation
* Infrastructure-agnostic deployments (AWS, Azure, On-premise)
* Notebook support
* Slack/Email notifications
* Additional production entrypoints and routes

To learn more about the entirety of the platform and how we can accommodate your needs, please reach out to us [here](https://dessa.com/contact/).

<h2>What is Foundations?</h2>

Foundations is a platform designed to manage and improve the machine learning workflow from experimentation to production. It easily integrates with any machine learning code written in Python.

It provides functionality for logging experimental outputs, caching re-usable data, recording data provenance information, and tracking experimental performance metadata. It provides a programmatic approach to launch experiments, which helps modularize model selection and hyperparameter tuning logic from model definition and data wrangling. Lastly, it provides a seamless flow to productionize your model with a standard interface and one-command deployments.
